# Ulva_Prediction
Problem Statement

	
	
	
In the experiment, we took PES (commercially available medium) in which we have replaced nitrate and phosphate.

Now for Nitrate source it was replaced with Urea and for phosphate it was replaced with DAP, also we have check the combined

Effect of Urea and DAP as a source of nitrate and phosphate respectively.

Initial weight of the Ulva in triplicate given below and increased weight on 21st day (also we have given for 7th and 14th day increased weight in mg). this biomass was grown in 250ml of medium

Now we have to do prediction of If we could scale up for 20000 litre tank what will be production output per day per cycle (21 days) per year

When we altered medium

Condition 1. What happens when if we only replace with Urea in the medium? (asper the data provided )

Condition 2. What happens when if we only replace with DAP in the medium? (asper the data provided )

Condition 3. What happens when if we replace combining Urea and DAP? (asper the data provided )
